# Subsocial Playground

Play with Subsocial SDK in our playground.

Subsocial Playground helps you run different code snippets from our SDK without downloading it.

### Usage 

On the left side, the Sidebar contains a list of code snippets that you might need while building your own dapp on Subsocial.

Press the run button to see output.

> There are a couple of inbuilt functions provided to help you focus on the main code snippet.
